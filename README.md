# Project Overview
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.
After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!

# Project Instructions
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

1. 0_Dataset.ipynb
2. 1_Preliminaries.ipynb
3. 2_Training.ipynb
4. 3_Inference.ipynb

### You can find these notebooks in the Udacity workspace that appears in the concept titled Project: Image Captioning. This workspace provides a Jupyter notebook server directly in your browser.

### You can read more about workspaces (and how to toggle GPU support) in the following concept (Introduction to GPU Workspaces). This concept will show you how to toggle GPU support in the workspace.

## You MUST enable GPU mode for this project.
